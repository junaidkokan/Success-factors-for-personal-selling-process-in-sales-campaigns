# Success-factors-for-personal-selling-process-in-sales-campaigns
Abstract Customers have the highest importance in any organization, particularly in Business-to-Business (B2B) context, due to high complexity of the selling process and huge costs of products or services involved. Besides, the available spectrum of customers is relatively less in industrial selling. Hence in the long term view, it is of prime importance to gain and retain customers. Various factors affect the process of selling products or services such as the organizationâ€™s environment, salesperson behaviour, selling process specific factors, technology utilised and so on. Consequently, this project aims at identifying factors affecting the marketing campaign executed by companies to gain new customers. By virtue of an extensive literature study, suitable factor levels for the identified factors are suggested (i.e. success factors). The findings indicate that market factors (organizational, environmental and stakeholders) are prerequisites for other factors to positively affect the marketing campaign. The personal selling process consists of a series of steps. Research reveals that the success of each step depends on the condition that the preceding step is a success. By employing the success factors and technology suggested in this project, the quality of marketing campaign and the probability of a sale can be increased along with high sales performance by salespeople.
